# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**\*Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!\*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

### Customer situation

Fabrikam, Inc. creates innovative IoT solutions for the oil and gas manufacturing industry. It is beginning work on a new, predictive maintenance solution that targets rod pumps (the iconic pivoting pumps that dot oil fields around the world). With their solution in place, companies will be able to monitor and configure pump settings and operations remotely, and only send personnel onsite when necessary for repair or maintenance when the solution indicates that something has gone wrong. However, Fabrikam wants to go beyond reactive alerting- they want to enable the solution with the ability to recognize problems, based on automated observation of telemetry data, so they can be averted before a fault occurs and the damage is done.

One of Fabrikam's challenges is managing IoT devices at scale. They want to be able to securely store credentials on their devices before sending them to their customers. When the devices connect to the cloud, they want to have an approval process that activates those devices so they can start sending telemetry securely. All data in transit must be encrypted.

Another decision point for Fabrikam is whether they would benefit from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud-based offering, or a more customized platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution. Fabrikam's technical leadership believes that, since IoT is not one of their top disciplines, and because technology is rapidly changing in the IoT space, they would benefit most from a SaaS-based solution. On the other hand, they want to know what the range of IoT PaaS options there are on Azure so they can make an informed decision on which route they should invest their time and resources. Given their current lack of IoT experience, Fabrikam would like to build a proof of concept using a SaaS product that they can quickly get started with to evaluate whether it meets their immediate and long-term needs. These needs include device management, visualization, reporting, control, and monitoring. Ideally, the solution will be highly scalable and secure, should they decide to transition from a PoC to a pilot deployment with several customers. When they do start expanding to several customers, they would like a transparent pricing structure they can use to project costs and pass those costs to their customers based on their usage.

Whichever cloud-based solution Fabrikam pursues, they want to know how they can visualize all of the data generated by sensors on each rod pump. These sensors include power output from motors, motor speed, the pump rate measured in strokes per minute, how long the pump is on, and casing friction measured in psi, to name a few. Each of these sensors output data at different rates and measurements, complicating any effort to build meaningful charts and dashboards. The information needs to be easily digested by analysts and technicians alike, with options to filter and explore the data over a timeline and within groups (oil pumps located within the same oil field). Ideally, there will be a customizable dashboard that shows crucial information at a glance. Fabrikam wants to know if there are out-of-the-box solutions for creating these visualizations and dashboards without involving developers and other IT staff.

Fabrikam has collected and compiled thorough maintenance and operational data of rod pump components and used this information to identify failure thresholds that identify an immediate or impending mechanical failure. Each of the elements of the rod pump's mechanism generates a consistent pattern in their telemetry when operating under normal conditions. If one of these components starts to degrade or suffers an operational failure, the signal reflects this change in status. When this change in status occurs, Fabrikam would like to automatically send an alert to engineers and field pump supervisors so they can potentially mitigate the issue and prevent damage to the failing and related components. In many cases, the fuel rod's onboard controller can modify the operating parameters of the pump to avoid or mitigate the impact of unexpected changes. Alternatively, if necessary, it can shut down the pump before any damage occurs and notify the company that repairs are necessary—protecting the machinery, and preventing potential environmental damage. Fabrikam would like to have a mechanism within their solution to send commands to rod pump controllers to modify these operating parameters remotely.

Their goal in the use of these monitoring capabilities and controls is to increase operator efficiency and safety. Addressing a typical maintenance issue takes several people and at least three days of system downtime at the cost of up to $20,000 USD a day, not including parts and labor. "By proactively identifying pump problems through automated monitoring, companies reduce unplanned downtime, which decreases costs, increases production, and increases the agility of maintenance services," says Fabrikam's Chief Engineer, Peter Guerin. He adds that the majority of industrial accidents don't happen at the well site; they happen when personnel is driving between sites. By eliminating the need for many site visits, they can reduce those accidents.

They would like to understand their options for expediting the implementation of the PoC. Specifically, they are looking to learn what offerings Azure provides that could enable a quick end-to-end start on the infrastructure for monitoring and managing devices and the system metadata. On top of this, they are curious about what other platform services Azure provides that they should consider in this scenario.

### Customer needs

1. They need web based access to metadata management
2. They need configurable dashboards
3. They need collection and export of real-time telemetry
4. They need security


### Customer objections

1. Is there an out of the box solution they can use to jumpstart the creation of the solution?
2. Can this solution enable their data scientists to leverage their expertise to build custom models against timeseries telemetry, and to plug their models into the near-real time streams collected by the solution?
3. How would data engineers get at rod pump streaming telemetry?
4. How can data engineers collect historical streaming telemetry for use in modeling by the data scientists?
5. What service would the data scientists use for training their model that could support the potentially large scale?
6. How could data scientists plug their model into a real-time predictive analytics pipeline to detect potential failures?
7. How would alerts be generated and delivered when the model predicts a failure?
8. How can the operators view the current status of the rod pumps in a single dashboard?
